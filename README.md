## Python Physics Library (PCS110)
This project was created as an end-of-year computer science (CPS109) project demonstrating an understanding of a variety of elemetns of python. My objective was to create a library specifically designed for my physics (PCS110) course.

### Features:
- Relevant constants (e.g. c, G, electron mass, avogadro's number, plank's constant, etc.)
- A vector class with static and instance methods
- Safe Type checking
- Docstrings at each function
- Over a dozen functions that use equations critical to the course (youngsModulus, hookesLaw, forceOfElectromagnetism, etc.)
- Ability to customize and load values of all constants (all saved in a .txt file)
- Ability to restore default constant values
- A simple optional GUI (made with tKinter) that works with the basic features of the library.
- A .txt file that holds a record of previous calculations done by GUI application
